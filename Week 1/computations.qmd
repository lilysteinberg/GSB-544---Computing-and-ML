This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data from the EPA.

```{python}
#| label: load-packages

from plotnine import *
from plotnine.data import mpg
```

@fig-scatterplot shows a positive, strong, and linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of these cars.
Additionally, mileage is higher for cars with fewer cylinders.

```{python}
#| label: fig-scatterplot
#| fig-cap: City and highway mileage for 38 popular models of cars.
#| fig-alt: Scatterplot of city vs. highway mileage for cars, where points are colored by the number of cylinders. The plot displays a positive, linear, and strong relationship between city and highway mileage, and mileage increases as the number of cylinders decreases.

(
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x="hwy", y="cty", color="cyl"))
    + geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2)
    + scale_color_continuous()
    + theme_bw()
    + theme(figure_size=(6, 3.5))
)
```

There are `{python} len(mpg)` observations in our data.
